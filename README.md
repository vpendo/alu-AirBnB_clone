# AirBnB Clone
# Project Description
   Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project aims to build a simplified version of the popular accommodation rental platform, AirBnB. The primary goal is to create a command-line 
   interface (CLI) that allows users to manage various objects within the AirBnB ecosystem, such as users, properties, bookings, and more.

# Command Interpreter Description
   The command interpreter serves as the backbone of our AirBnB clone project. It enables users to perform essential operations, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting 
   objects. The command interpreter is designed to facilitate efficient management of AirBnB objects through a simple and intuitive interface.

# How to Start It
   To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:
   ## step 1:
   ## Clone the Repository:
   https://github.com/vpendo/alu-AirBnB_clone.git

## step 2:
cd alu-AirBnB_clone


## step 3:
Run the Command Interpreter:

./console.py

# How to Use It
Once the command interpreter is running, you can start interacting with the AirBnB clone project using various commands. Here are some key commands and their usage:

1. Create <class_name>: Create a new instance of the specified class.

2. Show <class_name> <id>: Display details of the object with the given ID.

3. Update <class_name> <id> <attribute_name> "<attribute_value>": Update the specified attribute of the object.
  destroy <class_name> <id>: Delete the object with the given ID.

4.  All [class_name]: List all instances of the specified class, or all classes if none is provided.
quit: Exit the command interpreter.

# Examples

Here are some examples of commands you can use with the command interpreter:

1. create User
2. show Place 123
3. update Review 456 text "Great experience"
